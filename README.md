# Mullet_Detector

The script Mullet_classifier_train.py is a comprehensive script to leverage transfer learning from the pre-trained [VGG-16](https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/) model to classify mullets. Due to file size limitations, the *.h5 trained mullet classifier is not provided here, but please contact me at andronovhopf@gmail.com to request it. 

A dataset is included in the folder **data**: hand-labeled "Mullet" and "No_Mullet" examples (310 and 269 respectively) are provided. This is a subset of the public historical yearbook dataset created and published by [Ginosar et al.](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~shiry/projects/yearbooks/yearbooks.html).
